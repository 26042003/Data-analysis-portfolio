# Data-analysis-portfolio
data analysis portfolio containing 8 analysis project.


Here I conclude that, I would like to tell that after doing a thorough analysis 
we were able to derive the insights . from the data and was able to plot 
various graphs using that data. The ultimate purpose of data analysis 
initiatives is to gather insights and generate data-driven recommendations. 
These insights may help businesses make more informed decisions, optimize 
operations, and improve performance. The data that once looked useless 
became useful and helped to find out the courses that were a burden for 
Trainity to continue providing. Analysing the data proved helpful in finding 
various issues among the courses.
